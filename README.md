# PORTFOLIO PROJECT - 3

# BATTLESHIP

 Battleship or battleships as it is also known is a strategy type guessing game for two players (or in this case 1 player and the computer). It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player.

## INITIAL IDEA CONCEPT

 My initial idea for the project was to create the traditional game of battleships where the user will play against the computer and the computer will randomly select where they firstly place their ships before the game starts. The computer will then randomly try to find where i have placed my ships on the gameboard.

 * Here is a link to the [final project](https://battleship-1987-509de5bf3d9c.herokuapp.com/)
